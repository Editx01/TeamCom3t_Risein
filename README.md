## Blockchain Marketplace
A decentralized marketplace, similar to Craigslist, where users can list items for sale and purchase them directly using cryptocurrency. This marketplace runs entirely on the blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

## Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and secure marketplace where users can buy and sell items directly using cryptocurrency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

Eliminate intermediaries
Reduce transaction costs
Provide a transparent and immutable record of transactions
This platform enables users to experience the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) in everyday transactions.

## Features
 Decentralized Listings: Secure and immutable item listings on the blockchain.
 Cryptocurrency Payments: Transactions made using cryptocurrency for speed, security, and global access.
 Smart Contracts: Payments are released only when both buyers and sellers meet agreed-upon conditions.
 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive for listing, browsing, and purchasing items.
 Global Accessibility: Available to anyone with internet access and a crypto wallet.
 Transaction Transparency: Every transaction is publicly recorded on the blockchain.
