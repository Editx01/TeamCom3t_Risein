Blockchain Marketplace
This project is a decentralized marketplace, similar to Craigslist, where users can list items for sale and purchase them directly using cryptocurrency. The marketplace runs entirely on the blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and secure marketplace where users can buy and sell items directly using cryptocurrency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and provide a transparent and immutable record of transactions. This platform allows users to experience the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) in everyday transactions.

Features
Decentralized Listings: Users can list their items for sale on the blockchain, ensuring that listings are secure and immutable.
Cryptocurrency Payments: Buyers can purchase items using cryptocurrency, making transactions faster, more secure, and borderless.
Smart Contracts: Transactions between buyers and sellers are handled by smart contracts, ensuring that payments are only released when both parties meet the agreed-upon conditions.
User-Friendly Interface: The platform provides a simple and intuitive interface for listing, browsing, and purchasing items.
Global Accessibility: Anyone with internet access and a crypto wallet can participate, making it a truly global marketplace.
Transaction Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a public and tamper-proof ledger.

Smart Contract Deployment
If you're deploying the smart contract to a blockchain network, follow these steps:

Compile and Deploy Contracts: Use a tool like Hardhat or Truffle to compile and deploy your smart contracts:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
Update Frontend: After deploying, update your frontend to point to the new contract address in the .env file.
